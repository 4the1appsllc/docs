# Installing

1. Extract the files in this ZIP archive to a folder on your computer
1. Using an FTP client, upload the files up to your server
1. Make sure the cache folder and its two sub-folders are writable (you might need to change permissions to 777)
1. Access index.php through your browser. E.g. http://example.org/pdf-newspaper/index.php
1. If you haven't done so already, click on the link to run the compatibility test to see if your server meets the requirements
1. Enter a URL in the form field to test the code
1. If you get a PDF with the content you requested, all is working well.
