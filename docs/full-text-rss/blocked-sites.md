# Blocked sites

If you see 'URL blocked' when trying to use our Full-Text RSS hosted service, it means the site in question has asked us to block their domain from our service.

This does not necessarily mean they are against people using Full-Text RSS to read their content in a news reader (although obviously many ad-dependent sites which don't offer their own full-text feeds would much rather you click onto their site and be exposed to tracking and advertising). Often the reason they ask to be blocked is simply other sites abusing our service and re-publishing content they retrieve through Full-Text RSS.

If you'd like to use Full-Text RSS with sites that are blocked from our hosted service, you will have to use our self-hosted package on your own servers.
