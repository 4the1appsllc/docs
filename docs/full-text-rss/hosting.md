# Hosting

Full-Text RSS should works on most PHP hosting environments, but to get the most out of it, and to get the same results as our hosted service, we recommend you set up your server according to the instructions here.

Our [Installation](/full-text-rss/installing.html) page explains how to upload Full-Text RSS to servers which offer FTP access.

## Hosted plans

We offer [hosted plans for developers](https://market.mashape.com/fivefilters/full-text-rss) as well as [hosted plans for news enthusiasts](http://fivefilters.org/content-only/#section-pricing). These are the best options if you don't want to manage your own hosting account.

## Self hosting

::: tip QUICK START
If you're a customer, try our Easy Install steps when you login via the [member page](https://member.fivefilters.org/). The steps and script there will set up the server **and** install Full-Text RSS for you on your VPS server. It's the quickest way to get started.
:::

While Full-Text RSS can be used with most hosting accounts, we recommend running it on a VPS with our server initialisation script which will install all the necessary components.

We have a script to set your system up with all the necessary components. The steps will install (via Puppet) Apache, PHP and the extensions required to run Full-Text RSS and the rest of our PHP software.

::: warning NOTE
We recommend using your newly set up VPS server only for Full-Text RSS. But remember, with a VPS, system security and updates will be your responsibility.
